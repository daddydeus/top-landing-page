# Dominion City Accra Landing Page

As part of The Odin Project's foundations course, i was tasked with developing a landing page based on a given design template and visual guide.

Rather than just recreating an empty template which provides no value outside of being submitted as my project, i decided to sue this opportunity to create a landing page for my church.

Dominion City Acra branch is a small but growing community of believers and while we have a great reputation for being a place of worship that doesnt compromise on discipleship and teaching of doctrine, we needed some way to reach out to people in and around Accra.

## Lessons Learned

Due to the practical nature of this project i learned a lot more about HTML and CSS. I made use of FlexBox as well and this was a great opportunity to actually build something from scratch and see how Flexbox is used for layout building.

I faces a few challenges while building this such as

- unstable network connectivity
- inadequate computational power (yes my laptop is that bad)
- unforseen life events that took away sections of my time

but through grit and determination i was able to overcome my challenges and see it through to the end.
